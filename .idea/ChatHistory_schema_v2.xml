The `onScanResult` method appears to be an override method but there\u0027s no parent class or interface implementation declaration visible. This suggests this class should be implementing a callback interface that contains this method.\n\n2. There\u0027s a reference to a `scanCallback` variable which is used in both `startScanning()` and `stopScanning()` methods, but it\u0027s not defined anywhere in the visible code.\n\nThese are the two primary issues. Let me check if the file contains a proper scan callback implementation or if it\u0027s missing.\n\nLet\u0027s explore the class structure further to understand the context better.&quot;,&quot;signature&quot;:&quot;EqoBCkgIAxABGAIiQIUsX1ylaTtItYnMjEItX4p040SpnFnvEZsGtKhiIgx0HRHLjNvGV+TuQTYqf7mm2DJqWMiCjqBltodXOxGIYXYSDHMWjQdb6lCP412w1BoMVZtdBN79I7Xs2/u8IjAc4KnIbOA7x2m/O1WbGGpZQu3DoHGHjWxm5GKzrKAQZlozC+II26mPKWf6ePxVQpgqEAEu7WyC1/zgoe3J4h3KS/o\u003d&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Looking at your `BluetoothScanner.kt` file, there are two clear issues that need to be addressed:\n\n1. You have an `override fun onScanResult` method, but the class isn\u0027t implementing any interface that would contain this method. This should likely be part of a separate callback object.\n\n2. The `scanCallback` variable is referenced in both `startScanning()` and `stopScanning()` methods, but it isn\u0027t defined anywhere in the class.\n\nThese are actual code errors that will prevent compilation, not just incomplete features. You\u0027ll need to define the scan callback properly, likely using something like `ScanCallback` from the Android Bluetooth LE API.&quot;}]}]}" />
